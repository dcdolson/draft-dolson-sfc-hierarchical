      <t>
        Hierarchical Service Function Chaining (hSFC) is a network architecture
        allowing an organization to decompose a large-scale network into
        multiple domains of administration.
      </t>
      <t>
        The goals of hSFC are to make a large-scale network easier to reason 
        about, simpler to control and to support independent functional groups 
        within large network operators.
      </t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        Service Function Chaining (SFC) is a technique for prescribing 
        differentiated traffic forwarding policies within an SFC-enabled domain.
        SFC is described in detail in the
        <xref target="RFC7665">
         SFC architecture document
        </xref>,
        and is not repeated here.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document focuses on the difficult problem of implementing SFC
        across a large, geographically dispersed network, potentially comprised of millions 
        of hosts and thousands of network forwarding elements, and which may involve
        multiple operational teams (with varying functional responsibilities). 
        We recognize that some Service Functions (SFs) require bidirectional 
        traffic for transport-layer sessions (e.g., NATs, firewalls). We assume  
        that some Service Function Paths (SFPs) need to be selected on the
        basis of application-specific 
        data visible to the network, with transport-layer coordinate (typically, 
        5-tuple) stickiness to specific SF instances.
      </t>
      <t>
        Difficult problems are often made easier by decomposing them in a 
        hierarchical (nested) manner. So instead of considering a single
        SFC Control Plane (<xref target="I-D.ietf-sfc-control-plane"></xref>)
	that can manage (create, withdraw, supervise, etc.) 
        complete SFPs from one end of the network to the other, we decompose 
        the network into smaller domains operated by as many SFC control plane components.
        Coordination between such components is further discussed in the document.
        Each sub-domain may support a 
        subset of the network applications or a subset of the users. 
        Decomposing a network into multiple SFC-enabled domains should permit
	end-to-end visibility of SFs and SFPs.
	Also, decomposing should be done with care to
        ease monitoring and troubleshooting of the network and services as a
        whole. 
        The criteria for decomposition a domain into multiple SFC-enabled
        sub-domains are beyond the scope of this document. These criteria are
        deployment-specific.
      </t>
      <t>
        An example of simplifying a network by using multiple SFC-enabled
	domains is further discussed in
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-sfc-dc-use-cases"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        We assume the SFC-aware nodes use 
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh">NSH</xref> or a similar labeling 
        mechanism.
        Sample examples are described in <xref target="app1"></xref>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The "domains" discussed in this document are assumed to be under control 
        of a single organization, such that there is a strong trust relationship 
        between the domains. The intention of creating multiple domains is to 
        improve the ability to operate a network. It is outside of the scope of 
        the document to consider domains operated by different organizations.
      </t>

    <section title="Hierarchical Service Function Chaining (hSFC)">
      <t>
        A hierarchy has multiple levels: the top-most level encompasses the 
        entire network domain to be managed, and lower levels encompass portions
        of the network. These levels are discussed in the following
        sub-sections.
      </t>
      
      <section anchor="hl" title="Top Level">
        <t>
          Considering the example depicted in <xref target="fig_hierarchical_top"/>, a 
          top-level network domain includes SFC data plane components distributed over a 
          wide area, including:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Classifiers (CFs),</t>
            <t>Service Function Forwarders (SFFs) and</t>
            <t>Sub-domains.</t>
          </list>
          For the sake of clarity, components of the underlay network are not 
          shown; an underlay network is assumed to provide connectivity between 
          SFC data plane components.
        </t>
        <t>
          Top-level SFPs carry packets from classifiers 
          through a set of SFFs and sub-domains, with the operations within
          sub-domains being opaque to the higher levels.
        </t>

        <t>
          We expect the system to include a top-level control plane having
          responsibility for configuring forwarding policies and traffic classification rules
          (see for example, <xref target="I-D.ietf-sfc-control-plane"/>).
          The top-level Service Chaining control plane manages end-to-end 
          service chains and associated service function paths from network edge
          points to sub-domains and configures top-level classifiers at a
          coarse level (e.g., based on source or destination host) to forward
          traffic along paths that will transit across appropriate sub-domains. 
        </t>
        <t>
          <xref target="fig_hierarchical_top"/> shows one possible service chain 
          passing from edge, through two
          sub-domains, to network egress. The top-level control plane does not
          configure traffic classification rules or forwarding policies within the sub-domains.
        </t>
        <t>
          At this network-wide level, the number of SFPs required is a linear 
          function of the number of ways in which a packet is required to 
          traverse different sub-domains and egress the network. Note that the 
          various paths which may be followed within a sub-domain are not 
          represented by distinct network-wide SFPs; specific policies at the 
          ingress nodes of each sub-domain bind flows to sub-domain paths.
        </t>
        <t>
          Packets are classified at the edge of the network to select the paths 
          by which sub-domains are to be traversed. At the ingress of each 
          sub-domain, packets are reclassified to paths directing them to the 
          required SFs of the sub-domain.  At the egress of each sub-domain, 
          packets are returned to the top-level paths. Contrast this with an 
          approach requiring the top-level classifier to select paths to specify 
          all of the SFs in each sub-domain.
        </t>
        <t>
          It should be assumed that some SFs 
          require bidirectional symmetry of paths (see more in 
          <xref target="section_classifier"/>). Therefore the classifiers at the 
          top level must be configured with policies ensuring outgoing
          packets take the reverse path of incoming packets through
          sub-domains.

      <section anchor="ll" title="Lower Levels">
        <t>
          Each of the sub-domains in <xref target="fig_hierarchical_top"/> is an 
          SFC-enabled domain.
        </t>
        <t>
          	
  <xref target="fig_hierarchical_lower"/> shows a sub-domain interfaced with a higher-level 
   domain by means of an Internal Boundary Node (IBN). 
   An IBN acts as an SFC-aware SF in the higher-level
   domain and as a classifier in the lower-level domain. As such, 
   data packets entering the sub-domain are already SFC-encapsulated.
   Also, it is the purpose of the IBN to apply classification rules
   and direct the packets to the selected local SFPs terminating at an
   egress IBN. The egress IBN finally restores packets to the original
   SFC shim and hands them off to SFFs.   

        </t>
        <t>
          Each sub-domain intersects a subset of the total paths that are 
          possible in the higher-level domain. An IBN is concerned with
          higher-level paths, but only those traversing its sub-domain. A
          top-level control element may configure the IBN as an SF (i.e., the IBN plays the
          SF role in the top-level domain).
        </t>
        <t>
          Each sub-domain is likely to have a control plane that can operate 
          independently of the top-level control plane, managing classification,
          forwarding paths, etc. within the level of the sub-domain, with the
          details being opaque to the upper-level control elements. 
	  <xref target="ibn"/> provides more details about the behavior of an IBN.
        </t>
        <t>
	  The sub-domain control plane configures the classification rules in
          the IBN, where SFC encapsulation of the top-level domain is converted
          to/from SFC encapsulation of the lower-level domain.
          The sub-domain control plane also configures the forwarding rules
          in the SFFs of the sub-domain.

      <t>
        As mentioned in the previous section, a network element termed 
	"Internal Boundary Node" (IBN) is responsible for bridging packets 
        between higher and lower layers of SFC-enabled domains. It behaves as an SF to the higher
	level (<xref target="hl"/>), and looks like 
        a classifier and end-of-chain to the lower level (<xref target="ll"/>).
      </t>
      <t>
        To achieve the benefits of hierarchy, the IBN should be applying more
        granular traffic classification rules at the lower level than the
        traffic passed to it. This means that the number of SFPs within the
        lower level is greater than the number of SFPs arriving to the
        IBN.
      </t>
      <t>
        The IBN is also the termination of lower-level SFPs. This is because
        the packets exiting lower-level SF paths must be returned to the
        higher-level SF paths and forwarded to the next hop in the higher-level
        domain.
      </t>
      <t>
        When different metadata schemes are used at different levels,
        the IBN has further responsibilities:
        when packets enter the sub-domain, the IBN translates upper-level
        metadata into lower-level metadata; and when packets leave the
        sub-domain at the termination of lower-level SFPs, the IBN
        translates lower-level metadata into upper-level metadata.
      </t>
      <t>
        Appropriately configuring IBNs is key to ensure the consistency of
        the overall SFC operation within a given domain that enables hSFC.
        Classification rules (or lack thereof) in the IBN classifier can
        of course impact higher levels.
      </t>

      <section title="IBN Path Configuration"
               anchor="section_strategies">
        <t>
          The lower-level domain may be provisioned with valid high-level
          paths or may allow any high-level paths.
        </t>
        <t>
          When packets enter the sub-domain, the Service Path Identifier (SPI)
          and Service Index (SI) are re-marked according to the path selected by
          the (sub-domain) classifier.
        </t>
        <t>
          At the termination of an SFP in the sub-domain, packets can be
          restored to an 
          original upper-level SFP by implementing one of these methods:

        </t>

        <section title="Flow-Stateful IBN" anchor="section_flow_stateful">
          <t>
            An IBN can be flow-aware, returning packets to the correct
            higher-level SFP on the basis, for example, of the transport-layer 
            coordinates (typically, a 5-tuple) of packets exiting the 
            lower-level SFPs.
          </t>
          <t>
            When packets are received by the IBN on a higher-level path, the
            classifier parses encapsulated packets for IP and transport-layer (TCP, 
            UDP, etc.) coordinates. State is created, indexed by some or all
	    transport-coordinates ({source-IP, destination-IP, source-port, 
            destination-port and transport protocol} typically).
            The state contains at minimum the critical fields of the
            encapsulating SFC header (SPI, SI, MD Type, flags); additional
            information carried in the packet (metadata, TTL) may also be
            extracted and saved as state.
            Note, that the some fields of a packet may be
            altered by an SF of the sub-domain (e.g., source IP address).
          </t>
          <t>
            Note that this state is only accessed by the classifier and
            terminator functions of the sub-domain. Neither the SFFs nor SFs
            have knowldge of this state; in fact they may be agnostic about
            being in a sub-domain.
          </t>
          <t>
            One approach is to ensure that packets are terminated at the
            same IBN at the end of the chain that classified the packet at the
            start of the chain. If the packet is returned to a different egress
            IBN, state must be synchronized between the IBNs.
          </t>
          <t>
            When a packet returns to the IBN at the end of a chain (which is the
   SFP terminating node of the lower-level chain), the SFC
            header is removed, the packet is parsed for IP and transport-layer
            coordinates, and state is retrieved from them. The state contains 
            the information required to forward the packet within the 
            higher-level service chain.
          </t>
          <t>
            State cannot be created by packets arriving from the lower-level 
            chain; when state cannot be found for such packets, they must be 
            dropped.
    <!-- REVISIT: Med wanted:
          must be dropped by default. An IBN may be configured to forward
          packets that do not match an active state (e.g., ICMP error messages
          generated by a SF).
   -->
          </t>
          <t>
            This stateful approach is limited to use with SFs that retain the 
            transport coordinates of the packet. This approach cannot be used 
            with SFs that modify those coordinates (e.g., NATs) or 
            otherwise create packets for new coordinates other than those 
            received (e.g., as an HTTP cache might do to retrieve content on 
            behalf of the original flow). In both cases, the fundamental 
            problem is the inability to forward packets when state cannot be
            found for the packet transport-layer coordinates.
          </t>
          <t>
            In the stateful approach, there are issues caused by having state, such 
            as how long the state should be maintained,
            as well as whether the state needs to be replicated to 
            other devices to create a highly available network.
          </t>
          <t>
            It is valid to consider the state to be disposable after failure, since it
            can be re-created by each new packet arriving from the higher-level
            domain. For example, if an IBN loses all flow state, the state is
            re-created by an end-point retransmitting a TCP packet.
          </t>
          <t>
            If an SFC domain handles multiple network regions (e.g., multiple 
            private networks), the coordinates may be augmented with additional
            parameters, perhaps using some metadata to identify the network 
            region.
          </t>
          <t>
            In this stateful approach, it is not necessary for the sub-domain's 
            control plane to modify paths when higher-level paths are changed.
            The complexity of the higher-level domain does not cause complexity
            in the lower-level domain.
          </t>
          <t>
            Since it doesn't depend on NSH in the lower domain,
            this flow-stateful approach can be applied to translation methods
            of converting NSH to other forwarding techniques
            (refer to <xref target="section_other_forwarding"/>).

        <section anchor="enco_meta"
                 title="Encoding Upper-Level Paths in Metadata">
          <t>
            An IBN can push the upper-level SPI and
            SI (or encoding thereof) into a metadata field of
            the lower-level encapsulation (e.g., placing upper-level path
            information into a metadata field of NSH). When packets exit the
            lower-level path, the upper-level SPI and SI can be restored from
            the metadata retrieved from the packet.
          </t>
          <t>
            This approach requires the SFs in the path to be capable of 
            forwarding the metadata and appropriately attaching metadata to any 
            packets injected for a flow.
          </t>
          <t>
            Using new metadata header may inflate packet size when variable-length
            metadata (type 2 from <xref target="I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh">NSH</xref>)
            is used.
          </t>
          <t>
            It is conceivable that the MD-type 1 Mandatory Context Header fields 
            of <xref target="I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh">NSH</xref> are not all relevant 
            to the lower-level domain. In this case, one of the metadata slots
            of the Mandatory Context Header could be repurposed within the 
            lower-level domain, and restored when leaving.
          </t>
          <t>
            If flags or TTL (see <xref target="section_ttl"/>) from the
            original header also need to be saved, more metadata space will be
            consumed.
          </t>
          <t>
            In this metadata approach, it is not necessary for the sub-domain's 
            control element to modify paths when higher-level paths are changed.
            The complexity of the higher-level domain does not increase complexity
            in the lower-level domain.

        <section title="Using Unique Paths per Upper-Level Path" anchor="section_unique_paths">
          <t>
            This approach assumes that paths within the sub-domain are constrained so 
            that a SPI (of the sub-domain) unambiguously indicates the egress
            SPI and SI (of the upper domain). This allows the original path 
            information to be restored at sub-domain egress from a look-up table 
            using the sub-domain SPI.
          </t>
          <t>
            Whenever the upper-level domain provisions a path via the 
            lower-level domain, the lower-level domain control plane must provision 
            corresponding paths to traverse the lower-level domain.
          </t>
          <t>
            A down-side of this approach is that the number of paths in the 
            lower-level domain is multiplied by the number of paths in the 
            higher-level domain that traverse the lower-level domain.
            I.e., a sub-path must be created for each combination of upper
            SPI/SI and lower chain.
          </t>
          <t>
            A further down-side of this approach is that it requires upper and
            lower levels to utilize the same metadata configuration.
          </t>
          <t>
            Furthermore, this approach does not allow any information to be
            stashed away in state or embedded in metadata. E.g., the TTL
            modifications by the lower level cannot be hidden from the upper
            level.

		    The traffic with the above stack of two NSH headers is to be
		    forwarded according to the Lower-NSH header in the lower-level SFC
		    domain. The Upper-NSH header is preserved in the packets but
		    not used for forwarding. At the last SFF of the 
		    chain of the lower-level domain (which resides in the IBN),
		    the Lower-NSH header is removed from the packet, and then the packet
		    is forwarded by the IBN to an SFF of the upper-level domain.
                    The packet will be forwarded in the top-level domain according
                    to the Upper-NSH header.
		  </t>
		  <t>
		    With such encapsulation, Upper-NSH information is carried along the
		    extent of the lower-level chain without modification.
		  </t>
          <t>
            A benefit of this approach is that it does not require state in 
            the IBN or configuration to encode fields in meta-data.
            All header fields, including flags and TTL are easily restored when
            the chains of the sub-domain terminate.
          </t>
          <t>
            However, the down-side is it does require SFC-aware SFs in
            the lower-level domain to be able to parse multiple NSH layers. 
            If an SFC-aware SF injects packets, it must also be able to deal with adding

          metadata, as an indirection to the actual identifiers. The actual 
          identifiers can be assigned by control-plane systems. For example, a 
          sub-domain classifier could have a policy, "if pathID=classA then 
          chain packet to path 1234"; the higher-level controller would be 
          expected to configure the concrete higher-level pathID for classA.

      <section anchor="section_deSI" title="Decrementing Service Index">
        <t>
          Because the IBN acts as an SFC-aware SF to the higher-level domain,
          it must decrement the Service Index in the NSH headers of the
          higher-level path. This operation should be undertaken
          when the packet is first received
          by the IBN, before applying any of the strategies of
          <xref target="section_strategies"/>, immediately prior to
          classification.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="section_ttl" title="Managing TTL">
        <t>
          The NSH base header contains a TTL field <xref target="I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh"/>.
          There is a choice:
          <list>
            <t>a sub-domain may appear as a pure service function, which should
               not decrement the TTL from the perspective of the higher-level domain,</t>
            <t>or all of the TTL changes within the sub-domain may be visible to 
               the higher-level domain.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
           The network operator should be given control of this behavior, choosing
           whether to expose the lower-level topology to the higher layer.
           An implementation may support per-packet policy, allowing some
           users to perform a layer-transcending trace-route, for example.
        </t>
        <t>
           The choice affects whether the methods of restoring the paths
           in the sub-sections of <xref target="section_strategies"/>
           restore a saved version of TTL or propagate it with the packet.
           The method of <xref target="section_unique_paths"/> does not permit topology-hiding.
           The other methods of
           <xref target="section_flow_stateful"/>,
           <xref target="enco_meta"/>,
           <xref target="nest"/>, and

           have unique methods for restoring saved versions of TTL.

    <section title="Sub-domain Classifier" anchor="section_classifier">
      <t>
        Within the sub-domain (referring to <xref target="fig_hierarchical_lower"/>),
        once the IBN removes higher-level encapsulation from incoming packets,
        it sends the packets to the classifier, which selects the encapsulation
        for the packet within the sub-domain.
      </t>
      <t>
        One of the goals of the hierarchical approach is to make it easy to 
        have transport-flow-aware service chaining with bidirectional paths. For
        example, it is desired that for each TCP flow, the client-to-server 
        packets traverse the same SF instances as the server-to-client packets, but in 
        the opposite sequence. We call this bidirectional symmetry. If 
        bidirectional symmetry is required, it is the responsibility of the 
        control plane to be aware of symmetric paths and configure the
        classifier to chain the traffic in a symmetric manner.
      </t>
      <t>
        Another goal of the hierarchical approach is to simplify the mechanisms 
        of scaling in and scaling out SFs.
        All of the complexities of load-balancing among multiple SFs can be 
        handled within a sub-domain, under control of the classifier, allowing 
        the higher-level domain to be oblivious to the existence of multiple SF 
        instances.
      </t>
      <t>
        Considering the requirements of bidirectional symmetry and 
        load-balancing, it is useful to have all packets entering a sub-domain 
        to be received by the same classifier or a coordinated cluster of 
        classifiers. There are both stateful and stateless approaches to 
        ensuring bidirectional symmetry.

    <section title="Control Plane Elements">
      <t>
        Although SFC control protocols have not yet been standardized (2016), 
        from the point of view of hierarchical service function chaining we have 
        these expectations:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            Each control-plane instance manages a single level of hierarchy of a
            single domain.
          </t>
          <t>
            Each control plane is agnostic about other levels of hierarchy. This 
            aspect allows humans to reason about the system within a single 
            domain and allows control-plane algorithms to use only domain-local 
            inputs. Top-level control does not need visibility to sub-domain 
            policies, nor does sub-domain control need visibility to 
            higher-level policies. (Top-level control considers a sub-domain
            as though it were an SF.)
          </t>
          <t>
            Sub-domain control planes are agnostic about control planes of other
            sub-domains. This allows both humans and machines to manipulate 
            sub-domain policy without considering policies of other domains.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Recall that the IBN acts as an SFC-aware SF in the higher-level domain (receiving
        SF instructions from the higher-level control plane) and as a classifier
        in the lower-level domain (receiving classification rules from the
        sub-domain control plane). In this view, it is the IBN that glues the
        layers together.
      </t>
      <t>
        The above expectations are not intended to prohibit network-wide 
        control. A control hierarchy can be envisaged to distribute information 
        and instructions to multiple domains and sub-domains. Control hierarchy 
        is outside the scope of this document.

      <section title="Purpose">
        <t>
          This approach is expected to facilitate service chaining in networks 
          in which NSH-aware and NSH-unaware SFs coexist.
          Some examples of such situations are:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>In a period of transition from legacy SFs to NSH-aware SFs, and</t>
            <t>Supporting multi-tenancy.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
                  
      </section>
       
      <section title="Requirements for IBN">
        <t>
          In this usage, an IBN classifier is required to have an NSH
          conversion table for applying packets to appropriate lower-level
          paths and returning packets to the correct higher-level paths.
          For example, the following methods would be 
          used for saving/restoring upper-level path information:
          
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Saving SPI and SI in transport-layer flow state
	       (refer to <xref target="section_flow_stateful"/>) and</t>
            <t> Using unique lower-level paths per upper-level NSH coordinates 
               (refer to <xref target="section_unique_paths"/>).</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        
        <t>
          Especially, the use of unique paths approach would be good for translating 
          NSH to a different forwarding technique in the lower level. A single 
          path in the upper level may be branched to multiple paths in the lower level 
          such that any lower-level path is only used by one upper-level path. This allows 
          unambiguous restoration to the upper-level path.
        </t>

        <t>
          In addition, an IBN might be required to convert metadata contained in
          NSH to the format appropriate to the packet in the lower-level path.
          For example, some legacy SFs identify subscriber based on
          information of network topology, such as VID, and IBN would be
          required to create VLAN to packets from metadata if subscriber
          identifier is conveyed as metadata in higher-level domains.
        </t>
        
        <t>
          Other fundamental functions required as IBN (e.g., maintaining metadata of upper 
          level or decrementing Service Index) are same as normal usage.
        </t>
        <t>
          It is useful to permit metadata to be transferred between levels
          of a hierarchy. Metadata from a higher level may be useful within
          a sub-domain and a sub-domain may augment metadata for consumption
          in an upper domain. However, allowing uncontrolled metadata between
          domains may lead to forwarding failures.
          <list>
            <t>
              In order to prevent SFs of low-level SFC-enabled domains from
              supplying (illegitimate) metadata, IBNs may be instructed
              to permit specific metadata types to exit the sub-domain.
              Such control over the metadata in the upper level
              is the responsibility of the upper-level control
              plane.
            </t>
            <t>
              To limit unintentional metadata reaching SFs of low-level
              SFC-enabled sub-domains, IBNs may be instructed to permit
              specific metadata types into the sub-domain.  Such control of
              metadata in the low-level domain is the responsibility of the
              lower-level control plane.

             title="Examples of Hierarchical Service Function Chaining">
      <t>
        The advantage of hierarchical service function chaining compared with
        normal or flat service function chaining is that it can reduce the
        management complexity significantly. This section discusses examples
        that show those advantages.
      </t>

      <section title="Reducing the Number of Service Function Paths">
        <t>
          In this case, hierarchical service function chaining is used to 
          simplify service function chaining management by reducing the number 
          of Service Function Paths.
        </t>

        <t>
          As shown in <xref target="fig_example_flat"/>,
          there are two domains, each with different concerns: a Security Domain 
          that selects Service Functions based on network conditions and an 
          Optimization Domain that selects Service Functions based on traffic 
          protocol.
        </t>
        <t>
          In this example there are five security functions deployed in the Security Domain.
          The Security Domain operator wants to enforce the five different security
          policies, and the Optimization Domain operator wants to apply
          different optimizations (either cache or video optimization) to each of 
          these two types of traffic. If we use flat SFC (normal branching), 10 
          SFPs are needed in each domain. In contrast, if we use hierarchical 
          SFC, only 5 SFPs in Security Domain and 2 SFPs in Optimization 
          Domain will be required, as shown in
          <xref target="fig_example_hsfc"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          In the flat model, the number of SFPs is the product of the number of 
          functions in all of the domains. In the hSFC model, the number of SFPs 
          is the sum of the number of functions. For example, adding a "bypass" 
          path in the Optimization Domain would cause the flat model to require 
          15 paths (5 more), but cause the hSFC model to require one more path 
          in the Optimization Domain.

      <section title="Managing a Distributed Data-Center Network">
        <t>
          Hierarchical service function chaining can be used to simplify 
          inter-data-center SFC management. In the example of 
          <xref target="fig_example_hsfc_inter_dc"/>,
          shown below, there is a central data center (Central DC)
          and multiple local data centers (Local DC#1, #2, #3)
          that are deployed in a geographically distributed manner.
          All of the data centers are under a single administrative domain. 
        </t>
        <t>
          The central DC may have some service functions that the local DC needs,
          such that the local DC needs to chain traffic via the central DC.
          This could be because:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Some service functions are deployed as dedicated hardware 
              appliances, and there is a desire to lower the cost (both CAPEX
              and OPEX) of deploying such service functions in all data centers.
            </t>
            <t>
              Some service functions are being trialed,
              introduced or otherwise handle a relatively small amount of 
              traffic. It may be cheaper to manage these service functions in a 
              single central data center and steer packets to the central data 
              center than to manage these service functions in all data centers.

        <t>
          For large data center operators, one local DC may have tens of thousands of servers
          and hundred of thousands of virtual machines. SFC can be used to manage user traffic. 
          For example, SFC can be used to classify user traffic based on service type, DDoS state etc.
        </t>

        <t>
          In such large scale data center, using flat SFC
          is very complex, requiring a super-controller to configure all data centers.
          For example, any changes 
          to Service Functions or Service Function Paths in the central DC (e.g., deploying a new SF) would
          require updates to all of the Service Function Paths in the local DCs accordingly.
          Furthermore, requirements for symmetric paths add additional complexity when
          flat SFC is used in this scenario.
        </t>
        <t>
          Conversely, if using hierarchical SFC, each data center can be managed independently
          to significantly reduce management complexity. Service Function Paths between 
          data centers can represent abstract notions without regard to details within data centers.
          Independent controllers can be used for the top level (getting packets to pass the correct
          data centers) and local levels (getting packets to specific SF instances).
